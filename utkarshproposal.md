# GDC - Documentation Website Refactor

## Mentor(s): Bill Wysocki or Catie Bullen

Project Description: ***The Genomic Data Commons (GDC)***  documentation is used to present user guides, release notes, and other information to GDC users. Currently the website is written in a very outdated language and would benefit to being ported over to a newer framework.  This would be performed while staying in line with NIH guidelines for website format. Working on the GDC requires signing an NDA and completing two brief NIH training courses in information security.
