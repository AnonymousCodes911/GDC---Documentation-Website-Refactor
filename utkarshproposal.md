# GDC - Documentation Website Refactor

## Mentor(s): Bill Wysocki or Catie Bullen

Project Description: ***The Genomic Data Commons (GDC)***  documentation is used to present user guides, release notes, and other information to GDC users. Currently the website is written in a very outdated language and would benefit to being ported over to a newer framework.  This would be performed while staying in line with NIH guidelines for website format. Working on the GDC requires signing an NDA and completing two brief NIH training courses in information security.

# About Me:

I am an Undergraduate student at GCET India, a freshman pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Sciences. I love Contributing to open-source and have been actively contributing to them. I have been coding in various languages for the past four years and am ready to put them to work for a better cause. Coming around this project and working with this noble cause means a lot to me.

# Abstract:

The main goal of my work in this project would be to replicate and revamp the current website [GDC](https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov) which is getting outdated due to various obsolete dependencies.
After passing this initial milestone of renovating the website, the next step will be to start addressing the various other functionalities and utilities that can be added to the website to enhance the user experience and usability of the website.

# Technical Details: 

## The various technologies that will be used in the project are listed below : 

- ***HTML/CSS:*** will be used to make the in making the frontend of the website.

- ***Markdown:*** will be used to write the documentation

- ***CMS:*** we would need to work on a CMS to manage all the various genome datasets that are linked to the main [GDC](https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov) website. 

- ***JavaScript:*** JavaScript and its various frameworks would be deployed to make it more effective. 

- ***Python & Django:***  can be used later to increase the usability and feasibility of the website.

# List of Deliverables: 

- Write the code for the website from scratch.

- Replicate the existing website.

- Deploying the website with the feasible CMS.

- Improving the website for better usability.

- Host the website for public use. 

# Schedule of Deliverables: 

## To be Discussed with the mentor.

# Why I chose this Project and this Organization?

I have always wanted to be a part of an organization that helps the masses. Furthermore, as I connect with the importance of the work that GDC and its Database website do, I couldn't stop myself from being a part of this noble project.
I have made a personal website and always follow the path of learning by doing, so developing the website for GDC will also help me sharpen my skills in Web-Development being under the guidance of great mentors will be the cherry on the top.

Given my experience with programming in general, I am confident that I will be able to take up and complete this task.

# After Google Summer of Code

- Once the Coding period ends, I should have delivered the website and will be responsible for the repository created for the same.

- As this will be an Open Repository, I will guide and help all the other people who come to edit this website and make it better!

- I will always be a part of the CTDS and GDC family and regularly contribute to their projects.
